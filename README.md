**# AI-Chat-bot Integration Using Gemini API**

This project demonstrates how to integrate the **AI Chatbot** into a web application using the **Gemini API**. The repository provides a basic structure for building an AI-driven chatbot, which can respond to user input in real-time.

### **What I Learned and Integrated:**
I did not build the entire chatbot from scratch but learned how to use an existing **AI Chatbot codebase** and integrate it into my own **blog and e-commerce websites**. I focused on understanding how the **Gemini API** works and how to connect it to my project. Below is how I applied this knowledge to enhance user interactions on my site.

## **Features:**
- AI-driven chatbot powered by **Gemini API** to provide intelligent responses.
- Easy-to-implement integration for web projects.
- Designed for interactive user experience in blogs or e-commerce websites.

---

## **Technologies Used:**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js) ,Next.JS
- **Backend:** Node.js (for handling server-side requests, if applicable)
- **API:** Gemini AI for generating dynamic responses
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## **What I Learned and Integrated:**

Although I didn’t write the full codebase for the chatbot, I focused on understanding the integration of **Gemini API** into my web project. Here’s what I did:
- **Learned how to connect the Gemini API key** to the project.
- **Understood how to send requests to the API** and handle responses.
- **Integrated the chatbot** into my personal project (blog/e-commerce website) to provide users with an interactive AI assistant.
- **Customized the integration** based on my project’s requirements (e.g., adding the chatbot feature to the UI of my website).

### **Final Thoughts:**
I used this AI chatbot as a learning tool to understand how to integrate an external API into my own project, which allowed me to add intelligent features to my website. While I didn't build the entire chatbot code, I was able to modify and apply it in real-world use cases.
