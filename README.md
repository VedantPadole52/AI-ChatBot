# ü§ñ Gemini API Chatbot

### **What I Learned and Integrated:**
I did not build the entire chatbot from scratch but learned how to use an existing **AI Chatbot codebase** and integrate it into my own **blog and e-commerce websites**. I focused on understanding how the **Gemini API** works and how to connect it to my project. Below is how I applied this knowledge to enhance user interactions on my site.

This is a simple AI chatbot built using the **Gemini API** from Google. The chatbot takes user input and returns intelligent responses, demonstrating how to connect and use large language models in a web app.

## üìò About This Project

This project was created to learn how to **integrate the Gemini API** into an application. While I didn‚Äôt build the entire app from scratch, I focused on:
- Setting up the Gemini API
- Making API calls and handling responses
- Displaying chatbot messages in a UI

Some parts of the UI and structure were built using existing tools or templates, which helped me focus on learning how AI integration works in practice.

## üß† What I Learned

- How to set up and authenticate the Gemini API
- Making asynchronous API requests
- Handling user input and rendering responses
- Basic front-end integration with AI

---

## üîß Technologies Used

- Gemini API (Google AI)
- JavaScript / HTML / CSS (or React if used)
- [Add framework/tool if applicable: e.g., Vite, Bootstrap, etc.]

---

## üöÄ Future Improvements

- Add user authentication
- Improve UI/UX
- Add context memory to chatbot
- Deploy the chatbot to a live site (e.g., Vercel, Netlify)
